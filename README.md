# DML of Climate-Event Risk and Sovereign Bond yields Impacts

## Project Overview
This project's goal is to quantify how climate risks causally affect sovereign bond spreads and default risk.

### Stages
2. **Causal ML Analysis on Sovereign Bonds**: Merging climate vulnerability with sovereign bonds and confounding variables data and applying  a DML causal inference method to estimate effects.

Due to data storage constraints, this repository only contains the data analysis notebook 01 that performs the main baseline, placebos and heterogeneity tests. Data can be accessed as described below. 
## Main Data Sources
