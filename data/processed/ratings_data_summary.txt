RATINGS DATA PROCESSING SUMMARY
================================

Data Source: Individual CSV files for each country in data/external/Data/Control data/ratings/
Output: data/processed/ratings_monthly_panel.csv

PROCESSING METHODOLOGY:
======================

1. Date Range: 1980-01-01 to 2025-12-31 (monthly frequency)
2. Countries: 66 countries processed
3. Rating Agencies: Fitch, S&P, DBRS, Moody's
4. Country Codes: Three-letter ISO codes used instead of country names

DATA STRUCTURE:
===============

The output file contains the following columns:
- Date: Monthly date (first day of each month)
- Country: Three-letter ISO country code (e.g., ARG, USA, DEU)
- Rating_Fitch: Fitch rating (forward-filled)
- Outlook_Fitch: Fitch outlook (forward-filled)
- Rating_S&P: S&P rating (forward-filled)
- Outlook_S&P: S&P outlook (forward-filled)
- Rating_DBRS: DBRS rating (forward-filled)
- Outlook_DBRS: DBRS outlook (forward-filled)
- Rating_Moody's: Moody's rating (forward-filled)
- Outlook_Moody's: Moody's outlook (forward-filled)

FORWARD-FILLING LOGIC:
======================

1. Ratings are assigned to the month in which they were issued
2. Each rating remains constant until the next rating update from the same agency
3. Missing values indicate no rating from that agency for that period
4. Multiple agencies can have different ratings for the same country at the same time

EXAMPLE PATTERNS:
================

Country A (Argentina - ARG):
- 1980-1985: No ratings (missing values)
- 1985-11: First rating from Moody's (Ba3, Stable)
- 1985-12 to 1987-12: Ba3 rating continues (forward-filled)
- 1987-12: New rating from Moody's (B2, Negative)
- 1987-12 to next update: B2 rating continues

Country B (Germany - DEU):
- 1980-1986: No ratings (missing values)
- 1986-02: First rating from Moody's (Aaa, Stable)
- 1986-02 to 2012-07: Aaa rating continues
- 2012-07: Rating update (Aaa, Negative)
- 2012-07 to 2014-02: Aaa rating continues with Negative outlook

Country C (United States - USA):
- 2025-01: Multiple agency ratings
  * Fitch: AA+ with Stable outlook
  * S&P: AA+ with Stable outlook
  * DBRS: AAA with Stable outlook
  * Moody's: Aaa with Negative outlook

DATA QUALITY:
=============

- Total observations: 36,533 rows
- Countries with ratings: 66
- Date range: 1980-01-01 to 2025-12-01
- Missing data properly handled (NaN values for periods without ratings)
- All country names converted to standard three-letter ISO codes

INTEGRATION NOTES:
=================

This monthly panel dataset can be merged with other economic data using:
- Date column for temporal alignment
- Country column (ISO codes) for cross-sectional alignment

The forward-filling ensures that ratings remain constant between updates, which is the standard approach for credit rating analysis.
